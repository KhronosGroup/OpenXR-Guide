# OpenXR Guide Contributing

While open for contributions from all, there are a few contribution rules in
place.

## Ways to Contribute

- Fixing a typo, grammar error, or other minor change
  - Please feel free to make a PR and it will hopefully get merged in quickly.
- Adding new content
  - If you think the guide needs another page, please raise an issue of what
    topic you feel is missing. This is not a requirement, but we hope to avoid
    people spending thier valuable time creating a PR for something that doesn't
    quite belong in the guides.
  - If adding another link, clarification, or any other small blurb then a PR
    works. The addition of information needs to not be redundant and add
    meaningful value to the guide.
- Feel the guide is not accurately portraying a topic
  - There are a lot of ways to use OpenXR and the guide is aimed to be as
    objective as possible. This doesn't mean that the current information on the
    OpenXR Guide might be slightly incorrect. Please raise an issue what you
    feel is incorrect and a solution to how you would improve it.

## Images

All images must be no wider than 1080px. This is to force any large images to be
resized to a more reasonable size.
